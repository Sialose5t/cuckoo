# Design Goals

How does Cuckoo Network work for our community members?

- **For end customers** - More customers can now enjoy various AI Apps by contributing to the ecosystem or paying with crypto via Cuckoo Pay. If one app is blocked in their regions, then they can use another coordinator in the same decentralized network.

- **For AI App builder / coordinators** - Run coordinator node and stake to join the network. Cut GPU costs and gain more customers worldwide from various blockchain ecosystems. Assign tasks to Miners, validate results and pay rewards.

- **For Miners** - Run task node and stake to join the network. Earn tokens by sharing out GPU resources, running assigned tasks, and maintaining a reliable service.

- **For stakers** - Vote the coordinator or GPU provider you trust and then get rewarded by supporting the network.
