**Discover the Purpose Behind Cuckoo**

## Challenges in Current AI Systems

Artificial intelligence holds the potential to significantly benefit society, yet the framework it's developed within contains inherent deficiencies.

Centralized control and permission-based APIs, coupled with insufficient privacy and computational accuracy, and a lack of resistance to censorship, all compromise the expansive possibilities AI is capable of.

## Cuckoo is the Answer to AI's Limitations

Cuckoo represents a pioneering platform for the development of an open AI infrastructure. This network is based on a community-driven governance structure designed to address critical aspects such as safety, funding, strategic alignment, and the evolution of AI models.

## Introducing Decentralized AI

### Anti Censorship

Break through geographical limits and restricted networks to advance the global availability of open AI models.

### Privacy as a Priority

Promote user privacy using advanced, efficient statistical and cryptographic methods that do not degrade performance significantly.

### Comprehensive Verification

Ensure authentic results from genuine models. Develop validation protocols for models of any size, encompassing both traditional and foundational AI models, enhancing the trustworthiness of verifications.
